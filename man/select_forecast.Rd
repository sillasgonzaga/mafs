\item{test_size}{The desired length of the test set object to be used
to measure the accuracy of the forecast models.}

\item{horizon}{The forecast horizon length}

\item{error}{The accuracy metric to be used to select the best forecast
model from apply_all_models(). See error_metrics() for the available metrics.}
